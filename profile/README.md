## HOW TO USE THESE REPOSITORIES  

All repositories/examples work "out of the box" by connecting to our official Demo environment with a pre-defined user. However, you can easily edit them in order to use your credentials. 

## WHICH REPOSITORY TO USE

- C#/.NET:  [SLASCONE Demo (desktop/wpf application)](https://github.com/SLASCONE/SLASCONE-demo-wpf-nuget) or [SLASCONE Demo (console application)](https://github.com/SLASCONE/SLASCONE-demo-csharp-nuget)
- Java: [SLASCONE-demo-java](https://github.com/SLASCONE/SLASCONE-demo-java)
- C++: [SLASCONE-demo-cpp](https://github.com/SLASCONE/SLASCONE-demo-cpp)
